<p>Fort Wayne Police Department Sergeant C. Young had seen a suspicious vehicle behind an abandoned building. He went to investigate and the black van began to drive away from the building. Sgt. Young was able to catch up with the van and called out a traffic stop when he was informed by dispatch that the van was registered to Shane Nguyen who had been reported missing. The van had initially stopped but as he approached the vehicle it had sped of at a high speed. A vehicle pursuit began and the driver jumped out of the van and ran. The passenger of the car had then gotten into the driverâ€™s seat when the van started to slowly roll and then sped off. Sgt. Young decided to not pursue the van due to the high speeds.</p>
