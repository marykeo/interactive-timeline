<p>Matthew Cramer was found in Lakeville, Indiana by detectives and transported to Fort Wayne Police Department to be interviewed. During his interview he stated that on April 23, 2021 he asked Nguyen for a ride from Elkhart, Indiana back to Fort Wayne and had planned to kill him before they reached Fort Wayne. Once they got to Fort Wayne, Cramer had Nguyen drive Cramer’s storage unit. Cramer then had Nguyen turn his back to him where Cramer then put Nguyen in a choke hold, and held him in a choke hold until he went unconscious. While pulling him out from the van, Nguyen hit his head hard on the pavement.</p>

<p>Cramer states that he then dragged Nguyen’s body into the storage unit and completed killing him there. He then left Nguyen’s body in the storage unit, locked the door and went to Goshen Indiana. He also states that on Saturday, April 25, 2021, he went to Lowes with Carreon-Hamilton and Clements to buy items to dispose of Nguyen’s body. He gave money that he had taken from Nguyen, before leaving the storage unit, to Carreon-Hamilton and Clements to purchase the items he needed. He told detectives that he and Carreon-Hamilton had discussed how they were going to dispose of the body.</p>

<p>Cramer and Carreon-Hamilton dropped off Clements as they returned to Fort Wayne Saturday night. They went to U-Stor and unloaded the items from the van into the storage unit, closed the door and then proceeded to cut Nguyen’s body with a knife. He stated that Carreon-Hamilton helped by holding the body as he dismembered it and had coached Cramer on how to cut the body. He also states that Carreon-Hamilton was the one driving when Nguyen’s vehicle was first seen behind an abandoned building.<p>
